Leap Year Rule Recap:
A year is divisible by 4 (basic rule).
If a year is divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year.
Step-by-Step Process Using Arithmetic Sequence:
To use an arithmetic sequence for this calculation, we will count all the leap years that are divisible by 4 and then subtract the exceptions (years divisible by 100 but not 400).

Step 1: Leap years divisible by 4
We know that the first leap year is 4, and the leap years continue every 4 years. So, we can calculate the leap years divisible by 4 between 1 and 2018.

The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:

𝑎𝑛=𝑎1+(𝑛−1)⋅𝑑

Where:

𝑎1=4 (the first leap year),
d=4 (the common difference between leap years).
Now, we want to find the number of leap years from 4 up to 2016 (because 2016 is the last leap year before 2018). So, set an = 2016:

2016=4+(n−1)⋅4

Solving for n:

2016−4=(n−1)⋅4
2012=(n−1)⋅4
n=504

So, there are 504 leap years divisible by 4 from year 1 to 2016.

Step 2: Subtract the years divisible by 100 but not 400
Now, we need to subtract the leap years that are divisible by 100 but not by 400. These are not considered leap years.

To find how many years between 1 and 2018 are divisible by 100:

2018/100=20
2018/100=20

These 20 years are divisible by 100, but we need to exclude those divisible by 400. Let's calculate how many years between 1 and 2018 are divisible by 400:

2018/400=5
2018/400=5

So, the number of years divisible by 100 but not 400 is:

20 − 5 = 15

Step 3: Final Calculation
Now, we can calculate the total number of leap years:

Leap years
= 504 − 15 = 489

Leap years=504−15=489
Conclusion:
Using the arithmetic sequence method, we find that there are 489 leap years between 1 and 2018, which matches the result we got using the formula.
